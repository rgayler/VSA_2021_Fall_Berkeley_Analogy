## Motivation & Objectives

- Analogy is really cool and central to cognition
- Analogy is a good use case for the unique properties of VSA/HDC
  - What makes analogy hard for conventional computing?
  - Which VSA/HDC features might help with analogy?
  - Not a solved problem
- Use a set of attempts at analogy to highlight VSA/HDC design issues

## Outline

- What is analogy *really*?

- Plate - Hand crafted similarity
- Mikolov - Learned word vectors
- Kanerva - Simple substitution
- Emruli - Substitution with lookup

- Gayler - Graph isomorphism

## What is analogy *really*?

- Whatever it is, *Analogy* is **big**  
  - Everybody presents a different low dimensional projection of *Analogy*
    - Tendency to view the projection as the thing
    
- *Analogy* is too big to fit in this lecture
  - So I will resort to assertions and handwaving
    
## Analogy is the core of cognition    
  
- Analogy as a party trick (not!)
- Analogy $\gt$ Analogical Reasoning

## Relational generalisation (isomorphism)

## High level perception

## Hypothesis generation for IBE

## Plate - Hand crafted similarity

## Mikolov - Learned word vectors

## Kanerva - Simple substitution

## Emruli - Substitution with lookup

## Gayler - Graph isomorphism
