## Project structure

This code is structured as an [RStudio
project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)
using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) and
[Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

I assume you know how to run an R project, so won't go through all the
details of installation.

This project relies on the
[`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package to
record the versions of all the packages used by the project. You will
need to have `renv` installed. Call `renv::restore()` from within the
project to install all the versions of the packages used in this
project.

The `assets/` directory contains the images used in the slides. These
images are copied from various papers and these sources are acknowledged
in the slides.
